Since version 1.10
Disable get_system_cpu_times in _psmswindows.py which is useless And would crash wine.

def get_system_cpu_times():
    """Return system CPU times as a named tuple."""
    #user, system, idle = _psutil_mswindows.get_system_cpu_times()
    # jichi 10/5/2013: I don't need this. And it will crash on wine!
    user, system, idle = 0, 0, 0
    return _cputimes_ntuple(user, system, idle)

def get_system_per_cpu_times():
    """Return system per-CPU times as a list of named tuples."""
    ret = []
    # jichi 10/27/2013: I don't need this. And it might crash on wine!
    #for cpu_t in _psutil_mswindows.get_system_per_cpu_times():
    #    user, system, idle = cpu_t
    #    item = _cputimes_ntuple(user, system, idle)
    #    ret.append(item)
    return ret

# EOF
