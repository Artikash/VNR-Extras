Oh! Babel Helper Library 0.2 ( 2003/11/23 )

Oh! Babel Helper Library interface is changed to support multiple translation
software. Now, ChangshinSoft ezTrans XP ( http://www.cssoft.co.kr ) support is
added. ChangshinSoft ezTrans XP is investigated by
nightknight ( webmaster@mystictales.net ),
team leader of arcadia studio ( http://www.arcadiastudio.net ).
This is not compatible with Oh! Babel Helper Library 0.1

Oh! Babel Helper Library 0.1 ( 2003/11/13 )

This library is for Unisoft Babel TOP 2002. ( http://www.unisoft.co.kr )
Babel TOP 2002 is commercial Japanese-Korean, Korean-Japanese translation
software. Therefore, to use this library, you MUST buy it.

This library is for the programmers who are interested in using the Babel
TOP 2002 in their own program. Babel TOP 2002 is a translator software for
the normal PC users. And it's almost impossible for the programmer to use it
because the interface is not revealed. Now, I open the minimum interfaces of
Babel TOP 2002 for using the basic translator. This library may be used in
the various areas. For example, Babel TOP 2002 can be added to chatting
client and the chatting messages can be translated in a real time.

This source code is based on guessing without Babel TOP 2002 source code.
Therefore, some information may be wrong. Use this library AT YOU OWN RISK.
